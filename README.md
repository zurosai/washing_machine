# washing_machine

**Description**

This code implements a versatile system that controls a rotary LED display and interacts with buttons to provide user control.  The rotary LED display, composed of seven individual segments (A-G), can be manipulated by an analog input, typically a potentiometer. By adjusting the potentiometer, users can influence which segments light up, creating various patterns or numerical displays.

The system also features dedicated buttons for selection, pause/resume, and system power control. The selection button allows users to interact with specific functionalities within the system, potentially changing the behavior of the rotary LED display based on user choices. The pause/resume button provides a way to temporarily halt the updating of the rotary LED display, giving users control over the display's responsiveness. Finally, the system power control button allows users to turn the entire system on or off.

By separating the rotary LED control logic into its own library (crotary_led.h), the code promotes better organization and potential reusability. This modular approach makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and potentially integrate into other projects that require similar rotary LED control functionality. It allows developers to focus on the specific application logic without needing to rewrite the core LED control functions.

*rl_init()*: Initializes the digital pins for the rotary LED as outputs and initializes the analog pin for potentiometer reading.

*rl_read_value()*: Reads the analog value from the potentiometer and converts it to a bit mask representing the active LED(s).

*rl_turn_led_on()*: Turns on the LED(s) determined by the rl_mask value.

*rl_clear()*: Turns off all LEDs in the rotary display.

*rotary_led()*: Calls rl_read_value to determine the active LED(s), turns them on, delays briefly, and then turns them off.

<br>
<br>

**LED and Switch Control (led.c)**

*Purpose*: Implements functionalities for LED and switch control.

Details:

*rl_construct, rl_init, rl_read_value, rl_turn_led_on,* and *rl_clear* are included from crotary_led.h.

*rotary_led()*: Calls rl_read_value to determine the active LED(s), turns them on, delays briefly, and then turns them off. Prints debug messages based on the read value.

<br>
<br>

**Main Program (test.c)**

Purpose: The main program that controls the overall system behavior.

Details:

*led_state*: Stores the state (on/off) of the selection indicator LED.

*is_paused*: Flags whether the rotary LED function is paused.

*blink_state*: Controls blinking behavior of the selection indicator LED.

*system_on*: Flags whether the system is powered on.

*main()*: Performs the following:

Initializes LED and switch pins with appropriate directions and pull-up resistors.

Initializes rotary LED pins and ADC.

Enters an infinite loop that continuously reads switch states and performs actions based on them.

*System power control*: Toggles system_on on power button press.

# test.py

Functionality

This script demonstrates ESP32 communication with a server over WiFi and displaying information on an OLED display. It is directly related to washing machine output through UART protocol.

<br>
<br>

**Libraries**

_machine_: Provides access to hardware components like I2C, UART, and pins.

_ssd1306_: Controls the OLED display (SSD1306 driver).

_time_: For delays using sleep.

_socket_: Enables network communication using sockets.

<br>
<br>

**Configuration**

Sets up I2C communication for the OLED display.

Defines display dimensions (oled_width and oled_height).

Initializes the OLED display (oled).

Configures UART communication for serial communication.

**Functions**

_test_wifi_: Connects the Raspberry Pico to a WiFi network with the specified ssid and password.
